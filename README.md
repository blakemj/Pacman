CS107E Final Project

For my final project I decided to use the library that we have built in the class to create a bare-metal Pacman game. For this game, I extended my library to include functions that allowed for the movment of ghosts, pacman characters, the creation of a board, and an initial screen. I also implemented with NES controllers which are used to select how many players, determine when to start the game, and to move the characters. It is also possible to play the game in one-player mode with a PS/2 keyboard.

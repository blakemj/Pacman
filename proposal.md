Title: Pacman
Team Members: Blake Jones
Description: The goal of my project is to create a working pacman game. My lowest level goal is to create the game where pacman will move along a board and eat dots while the user avoids ghosts. I hope to have pacman at least move, eat dots, die/lose a life when hitting a ghost, and finish a game when all dots are eaten. I also hope for the game to end if the user uses up all three of their lives, and I want pacman to become invincible after eating a super dot. I also hope to implement with an NES controller to move pacman (although I will use a keyboard if this becomes too time consuming or too difficult). As a stretch goal, I want to give the ghosts completely different personalities, keep score, make pacman eat ghosts after eating a super dot, and to have more character-looking ghosts and pacman. 
Hardware required: NES Controller
Funds Requested: 10 Dollars
Task Breakdown: N/A
Goals for next week: Create the game board and the different graphical elements, get pacman to move around the board. Also, if the controllers come on time, work on implementing with the controller (I want to get this done ASAP).
